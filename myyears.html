<center> Howdy! Growing up, I was always fascinated watching my father code on his laptop. This inspired me to take a computer course during high school. I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of coding and decided to pursue a career in Computer Science. <a href="https://www.tamu.edu" alt=Texas A&M Univeristy>Texas A&M Univeristy</a> was not my first choice for college; however, ever since I have come here, I can proudly say that this is the best decision I have ever made. A&M is such an astounding university with the most welcoming people, exceptional academics and unrivaled traditions. As an Aggie you get countless opportunities to prove yourself.  Coming to 
A&M has not only introduced me to my best friends but it has also inspired me make the most of my education. I have made the effort to branch out and have been part of numerous organization throughout the years

<center> During the winter break of 2019, I was fortunate enought to be able to study abroad in Egypt. The biggest reason I wanted to study abroad was due to the fact that I would get an opportunity to see the world. By studying abroad, I knew that I would be able to experience a new country with new outlooks, activities, customs, and traditions. Now that I have gone to Egypt I can say that all of this was true. I got to see new terrains, natural wonders, museums, and landmarks of Egypt. I was able to witness the new culture and the distinct cultural perspectives. I tried new foods, witnessed customs and traditions, and partook in the social atmospheres. I am thrilled to have been able to witness a completely new way of life. Now that I am back from my study abroad experience, I have returned with a new perspective on culture, language skills, a great education, and a willingness to learn. Needless to say, this has also brought out my independent nature. Being in an unknown place by myself was overwhelming at times, but it tested my ability to adapt to diverse situations, while being able to problem solve. Through this experience I have become more aware of what the world is like and obtained remarkable personable, worldly skills. </center></font></p>

After graduation, I hope to work in the field of Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning. My future life and career goals include graduating in 3.5 years and hopefully finding a job with a reputable company when I graduate. I have already begun to take these steps to further my career. In the Summer of 2019 I interned with Union Pacific Railroad and for the Summer of 2020, I have been able to secure myself an internship at Dell Technologies. My future academic goals include getting my Masters of Business Administration after working for a few years.</center></font></p>
