Throughout my college career, I have taken multiple core Computer Science classes where I have learnt immense amounts of informtation that has been valuable in the past, and I know will continue to be valuable throughout the duration of my college career and once I graduate college and start working. I have always tried to contribute towards my major by joining clubs, or taking new courses online, or just learning things in my free time.</p></center></font>

 <font size="3.5" face=Arial Narrow><center><p>In my Junior Year, I applied to be an Engineering Ambassador. Essentially what an ambassador does is we talk to sponsors, donors, potential new students and even juniors and seniors in high school. My main focus on talking to these kids is my experience in Computer Science. These potential students tend to have many questions about the major and it being part of the College of Engineering because in many other colleges, Computer Science is a part of the College of Science or part of the Math Department. I try to assure these kids and promote Computer Science to them.</p></center></font>

   <font size="3.5" face=Arial Narrow><center><p>I have also joined the Texas A&M Data Analytics Club where I have been able to get introduced to a lot of new coding languages. A&M is known for mainly teaching C++ and by joining this club, I have been able to partake in various techincal trainings.

<font size="3.5" face=Arial Narrow><center><p>  At my intenship at Union Pacific Railroad, last summer, my peers and I collaborated to build out a customer facing suite of application prigramming interface(API). The reason UP decided to incorportae API's, is because this is one of the most promising aspects of technology right now and it would also help save UP an abundance of money, improve customer retention, and enhance customer productivity. Throughout my inetrnship, I used tools like Eclipse, Gitlab, and a Scrum Environment to get things done on a daily basis. Out goal was to work, manage, and deploy at least 10 services by the end of the summer, a goal which we were able to accomplish. During this experience, I was able to learn how to work in a professional setting and how to apply what you learn in college to a professional setting. I hope to take these traits I have leanred and apply it to all my future experiences.
