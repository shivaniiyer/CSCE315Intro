I am a highly proactive junior attending Texas A&M University who has consistently been praised as hard working by my teachers and peers. I’ve completed a great deal of coursework for my major in Computer Science, and my minor in Business, including Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Organization, Accounting, and Information Systems, where I was further able to understand the tie between technology and business.

<font size="5"><center><p>
In my previous two jobs, I spent a great deal learning how to acquire great verbal communication skills, patience, and leadership. In addition, I am part of two women’s organizations. These two organizations really helped me put myself out there and made me realize life is all about gaining new connections, networking, and paving a path for myself towards the future.</p></center></font>
<font size="5"><center><p>This past summer, I also managed to get hands on experience of what my career would look like in a big corporate setting. I had the privilege of working for 
<a href="https://www.up.com/index.htm" alt=Union Pacific Railroad> Union Pacific Railroad</a> as an IT Intern role in Omaha, Nebraska, where I learned valuable professional skills such as application development, programming, and troubleshooting. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven teamwork, attentiveness, and organizational skills, which I hope to leverage into the skills I will be using in the future, in my every day life.</p></center></font>
