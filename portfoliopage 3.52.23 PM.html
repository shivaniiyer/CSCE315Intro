Throughout my college career, I have taken multiple core Computer Science classes where I have learnt immense amount of informtation that has been valuable in the past and I know will continue to be valuable throughout the duration of my college career and once I graduate college and start working. I have always tried to contribute towards my major by joining clubs, or taking new courses online, or just learning things in my free time.</p></center></font>

 <font size="5"><center><p>In my Junior Year, I applied to be and Engineering Ambassador. Essentially what an ambassador does is we talk to sponsors, donors, potential new students and even juniors/seniors in high school. My main focus on talking to these kids is my experience in Computer Science. These potential students tend to have many questions about the major and it being part of the College of Engineering because in many other colleges, Computer Science is a part of the College of Science or part of the Math Department. I try to assure these kids and promote Computer Science to them.</p></center></font>

   <font size="5"><center><p>I have also joined the Texas A&M Data Analytics Club where I am able to get introduced to a lot of new coding languages. A&M is known to mainly teaching C++ and by joining this club they have a lot of techincal training where I can partake in and learn new things. Python is currently one of the most popular languages currenlty, and through this club I was really introduced to Python and during my technical training, I learned so mcuh more than I already knew about it!

<font size="5"><center><p> During the summer of 2019, I was able to receive an internship at Union Pacific Railroad, where I was able to apply the skills I learned in college to a professional platform. At my intenship, me and my peers collaborated to build out a customer facing suite of application prigramming interface(API). This was a completely new project to Union Pacific Railroad. The reason UP decided to incorportae API's, is because this is one of the most promising aspects of technology right now and it would also help save UP an abundance of money and improve customer retention and enhance customer productivity, hence they decided to incorporate it. Throughout my inetrnship, I used tolls like Eclipse, Spring RESR API, OpenAPI, Maven, JSON, JUnit, Gitlab, and a Scrum Environment to get things done on a daily basis. Out goal was to work, manage, adn deploy at least 10 services by the end of the summer, a goal which we were able to accomplish. During this experience, I was able to learn how to work in a professional setting and how to apply what you learn in college to a professional setting. I hope to take these traits I have leanred and apply it to all my future experiences.
